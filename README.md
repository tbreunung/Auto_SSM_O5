# Auto_SSM_O5

Computes the autonomous spectral submanifolds of order five in the parameterization variable. To construct the SSM we use the parameterization method and follow the notation introduced in [2].

# Citation
Please cite [1] if you use Auto_SSM_O5 in your own work.

# Remarks 
For a general introduction into nonlinear normal modes and spectral submanifolds and definitions of both we refer the reader to [3]. 

We also suggest the project of Ponsioen  (https://github.com/sponsioen/SSMTool) to advanced users.
